# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
The Kickstarter Analysis was targeted towards analyzing crowdfunidng data to present to a playwright who was hoping to launch a successful Kickstarter campaign to fund their own play, Fever. The estimated budget was over $10,000 to produce her own play and she was unsure whether this amount of funds could reasonably be raised.  
### Purpose
 By organizing, sorting, and analyzing the crowdfunding data, it's possible to determine what factors make a campaign successful. To understand how campaigns become successful, it’s important to examine all factors that influence the outcome. Aspects like when the campaign was launched and the goal amount set might has some weight over if a campaign is a failure or not. By mirroring the factors that produced successful campaigns, the playwright would be more likely to set up a crowdfunding campaign that would succeed. 
## Analysis and Challenges
Through analysis of the data offered through the Kickstarter data, it’s easy to determine what factors can cause a theater campaign to be successful. Breaking down the categories of Kickstarters to only include theater and plays allowed the analysis of only the most relevant cases. Filtering the data in this way allowed for the creation of targeted pivot tables that showed that the theater category of kickstarters were the most successful type of campaign in Great Britain, the best month to launch would be May, and that campaigns in the plays category are more likely to be successful.![Subcategory_Outcome_Statistics](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/102566199/162593231-3a71d257-26b0-407e-a436-d5445de91628.png). There were some challenges with finding the average number of backers because of the inability to divide by 0, so the IFERROR formula had to be implemented to stop this from causing the data to be unreadable. There was also the need to convert all of the time data, like deadline and launch date because they were written in unix time stamps. This was fixed by using the formula (((J2/60)/60)/24)+DATE(1970,1,1) to convert to an easily readable format. I then checked my formula's accuracy by entering in one of my timestamps into https://www.epochconverter.com/ as a test. Once I knew the formula was correct, I could use it for all the conversions. 
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
There was a relationship between outcome and campaign launch date demonstrated when inputting the pivot table of all successful, failed, and canceled theater campaigns throughout the year into a line graph. Based on the line graph that came from the analysis of theater campaign outcomes, it is shown that the most successful month to launch a Theater Kickstarter campaign is within the month of May. There is a tremendous spike of success, 111 campaigns, and then steadily declines in successfulness as the year continues. The playwright should avoid launching her campaign towards the end of the year.
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
Each campaign has a specific goal that represents how much money they would have liked to raise. By examining the outcomes based on the goal amount set, there might be conclusions drawn about if they are related. The graph that was produced through this analysis doesn’t allow for any strong conclusions to be drawn due to the inconsistency of sample size. This highest percentage of successful projects was 76% and this was in projects that had goals of less then $1,000, but that was found in only 186 projects. There were 534 projects launched with a goal of between $1,000 and $4,900 with 73% of them being successful, so this is a more reliable number because the sample size is bigger. After this spike in success at the lower goal ranges, there was a steady decline in successful outcomes as the campaign’s goal amount increased. There was a strange outcome on the graph that misrepresents the outcomes of campaigns over the goal amount of $25,000. The total number of projects decreases and this leads to the percentage of successful projects being high at 67%, for a goal range of $35,000 to $45,000, but there were only 4 projects launched in this goal range; therefore, it could lead to false assumptions of successfullness. 
### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
Challenges and Difficulties Encountered: There were specific issues with the production of the two outcome graphs for the launch date and the goal amount. For the launch date analysis, row labels were not displaying the month and instead were only displaying the quarters of the year. The quarters had to be deleted and then the row filter had to be used to select only the months. This rendered the needed format to create the line graph. The only other serious difficulty was creating the line graph based on the goal amount because the COUNTIFS formula was difficult to use when doing the goal ranges that required the entry of two goal amounts.
## Results
**- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?**
The Outcomes based on Launch Date line graph allows for the conclusion that the most successful month for theater Kickstarters is within the month of May, which is followed by a steady decline. A person hoping to launch a successful Kickstarter should aim to launch it in May and should avoid launching any campaigns in the last 3 months of the year. The worst month to launch a campaign would be December because successful campaigns drop and almost equal the amount of failed ones. 
**- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?**
It is extremely difficult to come to a conclusion based on the line graph that shows the Outcomes based on Goals. If the sample  size was more standard, then a more concrete conclusion could be drawn. Although it lacks a clear linear nature, it possible to see that goals that are between $1,000 to $9,999 will lead to the highest success rate. 
**- What are some limitations of this dataset?**
The biggest limitation of the dataset is that the only information that is available is that of monetary value. The data is only representing liquid donations, but cannot account for the hours work that might have been donated to the campaign or any non-liquid donations. Since there is only money to work off of, conclusions about successfulness of a campaign might not be reliable. Another limitation presented itself within the goal amount analysis of the outcomes. In this analysis, the sample size did not stay standard enough to make a strong conclusion. Instead, there is an extremely low sample size for the campaigns that have a goal amount of $50,000 or higher. There is so much variation between goal amounts once it surpasses $50,000 that it doesn't allow for a strong relation to be drawn. 
**- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?**
To analyze the data further, a graph that analyzes how Theater Kickstarters perform in different countries. This would allow for the playwright to understand which country would increase her successfulness. A stacking bar chart could be used to cross reference the failures and successes between different countries and which categories/subcategories. Comparing the outcomes based on whether or not a project was spotlighted also might allow for the conclusion on how much advertising affects the success rate. The usefulness of the data is tied to how it can benefit the consumer, so any table or graph that can increase their chance of being significantly more successful should be included.
